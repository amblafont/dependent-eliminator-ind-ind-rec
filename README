Attempts to simulate the full dependent inductive-inductive-recursive eliminator in Coq with UIP.

Some people think it is not possible in general. Let us try to find a simple one for which it is impossible

./configure
make

conTyEl.v is an example of a inductive inductive datatype whose full dependent eliminator can be simulated in Coq.

Note : Folsberg in his phD translates inductive-inductive non-dependent recursors to an extensional type theory with only indexed inductive datatypes. Extensional type theory can be translated to intensional type theory with UIP and funext.
However, Ambruse Kaposi formalized a translation of the conTyEl (non dependent) recursor into ITT without any axiom :

The question : could it work also for the dependent eliminator, and if not, why ?
